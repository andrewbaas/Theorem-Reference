# Introduction to Metamathematics

### Stephen Cole Kleene

This document is made to be a tool to assist understanding and retention. This particular text by Kleene is one I am currently working through (thus the partial presentation) but which I am thoroughly enjoying. I particularly enjoy the fundamental proofs and the clean and intuitive presentation of the ideas.

This book is so much more than a sum of its proofs, so use this as a tool, not as a substitute.
